              <hr>
              <p>Want to waste your time on learning something completely esoteric and useless?  If not then you should find another site.  This site is dedicated to old complex coding languages that are no longer in use.  To learn these is purely a labor of love and will not help you in any way.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">FORTRAN</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Made popular back in the 1950's FORTRAN is a complex and hard to use.  However if you are coding punch cards on a vintage mainframe you will need to brush up on your FORTRAN.  It is still in use today however so beware--were you to learn this language chances are you would still get a job.</p>

              <hr>
              <p>A really useless code to learn would be COBOL.  Designed as a dedicated business software for companies in-house software COBOL is not used today.  However for time travel purposes COBOL could be important to learn.</p>

              <hr>
              <p>Lisp is an obscure and difficult mathematics programing language.  To learn Lisp is not impossible, but its hard and its uses are very obscure.  Not useless, but not very useful either. </p>

              <hr>
              <p>Pascal is a very early programing language that is no longer in use.  There are much better options now, learning Pascal would be a very strange thing to do unless you had large amounts of free time.</p>

              <hr>
              <p>Made popular on early home PC's from the 1980's Basic is a fun and simple programing language to learn.  Its not in use anywhere today but it would not take long to learn and would be fun to get up and running on an old Apple II.</p>

              <p>Some one in your situation should not waste time learning a useless coding language--just learn JavaScript, its used by everyone for pretty much everything these days.</p>
