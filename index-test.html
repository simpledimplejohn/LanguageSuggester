      <h2>What Not To Learn</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Want to waste your time on learning something completely esoteric and useless?  If not then you should find another site.  This site is dedicated to old complex coding languages that are no longer in use.  To learn these is purely a labor of love and will not help you in any way.</p>

    <div id="fortran" class="previous">
      <h2>FORTRAN</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Made popular back in the 1950's FORTRAN is a complex and hard to use.  However if you are coding punch cards on a vintage mainframe you will need to brush up on your FORTRAN.  It is still in use today however so beware--were you to learn this language chances are you would still get a job.</p>
